# The goal is to find the largest square (not island) formed entirely by 1s in a binary matrix.

# We use dynamic programming to keep track of the largest square that ends at each (i, j).
# dp[i][j] will store the side length of the biggest square ending at that cell.

# If the cell at (i, j) is a 1, we check its top (i-1, j), left (i, j-1), and top-left (i-1, j-1) neighbors.
# The smallest of those three values plus 1 becomes dp[i][j].

# For example, if all three neighbors have squares of side length 2, then (i, j) can form a 3x3 square.

# We track the largest side length seen during this process in the max_side variable.
# Finally, we return the area, which is max_side ** 2.

# Time complexity is O(m * n) because we iterate through every cell once.
# Space complexity is also O(m * n) for the DP matrix, but it can be optimized to O(n) if needed.
